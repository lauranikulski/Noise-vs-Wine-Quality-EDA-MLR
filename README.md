# Noise-vs-Wine-Quality-EDA-MLR
 Predictive Judgments: Python × Daniel Kahneman
https://community.codecademy.com/events/details/codecademy-seoul-presents-predictive-judgments-python-x-daniel-kahneman-30-minutes/

Ever since Danny turned me on to Daniel Kahneman, I have (like so many others) been awed by the pure genius of the man. 

Kahneman's latest work, Noise - A Flaw in Human Judgment contains a section in chapter 9 (Judgments and Models) that inspired this meet-up.  

At the beginning of the meet-up, we will spend 5-10 minutes on Kahneman's work on predictive judgments as made by professionals vs models vs simple rules. 

Following that, we will look at a red wine dataset sourced via Kaggle and use it to predict wine quality. If you would like to follow along, feel free to download it prior, though just watching is fine too.
